UFOs Project and Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

The overview of this analysis and project was to use HTML, Java Script, and CSS to create a webpage that can be interactive and easy viewing for the user by creating a table for the data, and also using filters to provide a way for the user to retreive more specific data back such as date, city, state, country, and shape. 

The purpose is well defined (2 pt)
Results:
When you load the webpage, this is what is displayed which is an introduction explaining what data and type of data is available in the table, and show's the table, how it's divided, and where you could search inputs to get more specific outputs.

This is what the table looks like in the webpage, and is already auto populated with data for easy viewing.

This is where the filters were put in place and you could retreive more specific, accurate information based on what the user is looking for.

If there was an input that was searched that wasn't in the data, the table would populate empty such as this example:

One drawback of this webpage: 
THe webpage is overall very appealing and has the ambiance of a supernatural/UFO type of page. A potential drawback is the filter table not being as invitating to input and search through the data. The "Filter Table" title should be changed to something more clear and invitating so when individuals come to the webpage, they know right away it is welcomed to search the data to get what they're curious and looking for back, whether it is there or not. A title could maybe be used and a subheader maybe to explain, and also input something so when you hover over it, it'll say something to help the user navigate the webpage.

Further recommendations:
When a user searches for something and nothing is received back, we can maybe have something populate to show nothing was available at the moment, and it can be informative and also with humor which adds to the user experience. If that is not an option, having a drop down box for each filter can help users get to the data they're looking for, without having to wait to see if it's available or not, which can also add to the user experience. Also, maybe adding a "Go" or "Enter" option after the user enters their inputs to populate the data, can help those who may be older or not tech savy to know to hit the enter button to populate the data for them.
